# Supplied checks for your program.
#
# Run from this folder:
#
#     python3 test.py -v
#
# These checks fail until Museum.py runs and prints the expected nine lines for
# each one. They do NOT cover everything your program must handle: designing
# your own test cases (up to ten, in tests.txt) is a separate, graded part of
# the assignment -- see "Testing your program" in brief.md. Predict
# every expected output by reasoning about the rules before you run anything.
#
# What you should see:
#
# - ALL checks passing ends with:
#
#       ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#       Ran 3 tests in ...s
#
#       OK
#
# - If SOME checks fail, each failed one is listed under "FAIL:" with a diff
#   between what your program printed and what was expected; the run ends with
#   "FAILED (failures=N)". (With the untouched skeleton you will see an error
#   for every test, because the ??? placeholders are not valid Python.)
#
# Fix the first failing case and re-run; repeat until you get "OK".
